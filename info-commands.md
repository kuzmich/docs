# GNU Info commands

A node contains text describing a specific topic at a specific level of detail.
The mode line at the bottom `(info)Help` says that this is node ‘Help’ in the file ‘info’.
The top line of a node is its “header”. The header `Next: Help-P,  Prev: Help-Small-Screen,  Up: Getting Started` 
says that the ‘Next’ node after this one is the node called ‘Help-P’. Below the header line is node's topic or title.
